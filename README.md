# OpenJLPT-ZH-premium

**English** · [日本語](README.ja.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An independently maintained Japanese learning project based on [OpenJLPT](https://github.com/evanclan/OpenJLPT). AntaresGG adds Simplified Chinese learning content and study workflow improvements, preserving upstream history, attribution, stable IDs and the static-site architecture.

## Dataset and Chinese coverage

Full dataset totals and Chinese coverage are different. Entries without Chinese content retain their English fields.

| Level | Words: Chinese / total | Grammar: Chinese / total | Chinese example translations |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| N5 | 674 / 674 | 81 / 81 | 1,574 |
| N4 | 630 / 630 | 98 / 98 | 1,538 |
| N3 | 1,659 / 1,659 | 101 / 101 | 3,602 |
| N2 | 1,778 / 1,778 | 123 / 123 | 3,651 |
| N1 | 3,070 / 3,070 | 123 / 123 | 6,351 |
| **Total** | **7,811 / 7,811** | **526 / 526** | **16,716** |

Snapshot checked on 2026-10-28 against the repository [JSON data](data/json) and the [quality report](data/quality-report.json). The dataset also contains 2,383 kanji. All N5–N1 vocabulary and grammar are now covered in Chinese, including translations of every example. Chinese kanji meanings and a fully Chinese interface are outside this snapshot's completed scope.

- Chinese search, spaced-repetition flashcards, saved progress across deck switches and reloads, and persistent shuffle mode.
- JSON, CSV and SQLite exports; bilingual Anki decks preserving note IDs. Yomitan exports provide JLPT-level metadata, not definitions.
- Original English fields and stable IDs remain available through JavaScript/TypeScript and Python APIs.
- Chinese content was AI-authored and reviewed by Codex under owner authorization, not independently reviewed by a human. Review hashes and provenance remain in maintenance data. Stale Chinese content falls back to English in learning views and exports.

See the [Chinese maintenance notes](README.zh-CN.md) for review records and known limitations. JLPT levels are community estimates, not official exam lists.

## Download and install

Download data, Anki decks, Yomitan dictionaries and JavaScript/Python packages from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AntaresGG/OpenJLPT-ZH-premium/releases). The independent version is **v0.4.0**; inherited v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 tags belong to upstream history.

This project has not been published to npm or PyPI. The registry package `openjlpt` is the upstream product. Use this repository's release packages or install from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AntaresGG/OpenJLPT-ZH-premium.git
cd OpenJLPT-ZH-premium
npm ci
npm run build:pkg
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript

Install the `.tgz` package from this project's Releases in your consuming project, then import:

```ts
import { searchVocab, getGrammar } from 'openjlpt-zh-premium';

const words = searchVocab('肥皂');
const grammar = getGrammar('N3');
```

The main entry uses Node.js file access. Browser applications should bundle the JSON files from `data/json/` or serve them as static assets.

### Python

From the repository root, install into a separate environment to avoid mixing with upstream's identically named import package:

```sh
uv venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python .
# Windows: uv pip install --python .venv/Scripts/python.exe .
```

```python
from openjlpt import search_vocab, get_grammar

words = search_vocab("肥皂")
grammar = get_grammar("N3")
```

The distribution is named `openjlpt-zh-premium`; the Python import and CLI remain `openjlpt`.

## Validation and deployment

Run from the repository root:

```sh
npm run check:data
npm run validate
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build:pkg
uv run --no-project --with pytest --with genanki python -m pytest -q
npm run audit:data
```

`npm run prepare:data` applies guarded corrections and merges Chinese content offline using committed sources. A full `npm run build` downloads upstream sources and requires tar/bzip2; review upstream changes before integration.

The website is static and requires no database service. Set `SITE_URL` to the actual deployment base URL, then build pages and downloads:

```sh
npm run build:site -- _site
uv run --no-project --with genanki python scripts/build_exports.py _site/downloads
```

See [Mac mini deployment](docs/DEPLOY-MACOS.md). Commit and push from PC to GitHub, then pull and deploy the same revision on Mac. GitHub Pages is disabled by default; host addresses belong in local configuration.

## Repository governance

- Product: `AntaresGG/OpenJLPT-ZH-premium`; `origin/main` is the product source of truth.
- Contribution fork: `AntaresGG/OpenJLPT`; keep product-specific changes off its `main`.
- Upstream: `evanclan/OpenJLPT`; start isolated `contrib/*` branches from freshly fetched upstream `main`.
- Migration baseline: `migration-baseline-2026-10-28` at `f72221983fb4c970411ac9a753f6796473321164`.

Use `feature/*` branches and reviewed PRs for product changes. See [governance and releases](docs/GOVERNANCE.md), [upstream contribution tracking](UPSTREAM_CONTRIBUTIONS.md) and the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
